        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 â€“ 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist, who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British Rule, and in turn inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.</p>
        <p>Gandhi is commonly known as "Mahatma" Gandhi, meaning "Great Soul" or "Saint", and was fondly called Bapu (Father) in India. His birthday, 2 October, is commemorated as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and world-wide as the International Day of Nonviolence.</p>
        <p>Gandhi's ideas and strategies of nonviolent civil disobedience influenced civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
        <p>He studied law in London and began practicing in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1891. In 1915, he returned to India and became involved in the Indian nationalist movement.</p>
        <p>Gandhi was a deeply spiritual person who believed in the power of love and compassion. He lived a simple lifestyle and famously wore a dhoti and shawl, which became the symbol of the Indian independence movement. Gandhi also worked to promote social justice and equality, including fighting against the caste system and advocating for the rights of women.</p>
        <p>Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by a Hindu nationalist who disagreed with his views on the partition of India. Despite his death, his legacy continues to inspire people around the world to fight for justice and peace through nonviolence and civil disobedience.</p>
